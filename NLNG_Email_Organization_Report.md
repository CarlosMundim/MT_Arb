2. **Forward Patterns:** Significant forwarding activity suggests information sharing across multiple parties
3. **External Communications:** Several emails marked [EXTERNAL] indicate communications with outside parties
4. **Duplicate Handling:** Some conversations appear in multiple locations (main directory and subdirectories)

### Chronological Indicators
- Original emails typically lack RE:/FW: prefixes
- Reply levels can be determined by counting RE:/FW: occurrences
- Numbered versions (1), (2), etc. often indicate revised or additional communications in same thread

### Participants (Based on Email Subjects)
- **Internal:** Carlos Mundim, Alex Carraro, Felix Wong
- **External Entities:** NLNG, MyTerra SA, Credit Suisse, Commercial Register Office, Tax Offices
- **Geographic Focus:** Nigeria (NLNG), Switzerland (MyTerra SA), Brazil operations, Rome meetings

## Recommendations for Organization

1. **Use the 10-folder structure** proposed above for clear categorization
2. **Maintain chronological order** within each conversation thread
3. **Create cross-references** for emails that relate to multiple topics
4. **Preserve original file names** for traceability
5. **Consider separate archive** for duplicate files found in subdirectories

## Implementation

A batch script has been generated (`organize_nlng_emails.bat`) to automatically copy files from the source directory into the organized folder structure while preserving originals.
